    <p>My interest in editing brought me to the DGMD program.  I am excited to try my hand at learning how to code for the 5th decade in a row. Ultimately, I want to create <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/scrollytelling-examples/" target = _blank>scrollytelling webpages</a>, bringing together many of the skills I have learned in the DGMD program.
